## Steps

#### Explore

Explore the current application and analyze its functionality.

#### Global Context and useReducer

Set up global context and immediately create a general setup for useReducer. Create two files, one for reducer and one for actions.

#### Map

In the default state, set cart not as an array but as a new Map().

#### Functionalities

Create the following functionalities:

Clear Cart - an action that clears the entire cart.
Remove Item - an action that removes a specific item from the cart.
Increase Amount - an action that increases the quantity of a specific item in the cart.
Decrease Amount - an action that decreases the quantity of a specific item in the cart.
Fetch Data - an action that fetches data from an API and stores it in the cart state.
Calculate Totals - a function that calculates the total cost of items in the cart.
Implement these functionalities in the reducer and actions files, and make them available in the global context.

#### Test

Test the functionality of the application and fix any issues that arise.

The flow of the application should look something like this:

- Explore the current application and analyze its functionality.
